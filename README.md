# Write-More-Better
A grammar checker for Microsoft Word

*Its a bit like [Editsaurus](https://github.com/tylerwalters/editsaurus) or Hemingway Editor for Word. See a list of [alternative software](https://alternativeto.net/software/editsaurus/) for the full gist of what this enables you and your team to do.*

Is this useful to you?  Would you like to make it better?  Let me know by writing something in the [**Issues**](https://github.com/Travis42/Write-More-Better/issues) section up top.

## The main advantages of using a Word VBA script over an online grammar checker:
- You can check large documents (~200 pages or more) easily
- If the document is sensitive, you won't risk sending such information to a server somewhere on the Internet.  Everything stays with you.

## But Macros and scripts can be dangerous to use!
It is dangerous out there.  Click on Write More Better.vbs to read the script, so you'll know that there's nothing up.  If you like, you can manually add it to your own Word document instead of using my .docm file using the following steps.  I understand your concerns.

## Steps to use:

### Method 1:
-	Alt-F11, copy the script
-	Open a copy of your paper, Alt-F11
-	Choose Insert --> module
-	Paste the script into the module screen
-	F5 while your cursor has selected the script screen, grab a coffee
-	'Save as' something if you like.

### Method 2:
-	Paste your content into the docm.
-	Alt-F11, find the script (should come right up)
-	F5 while your cursor has selected the script screen, grab a coffee
-	'save as' something if you like.
