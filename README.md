# Concision Editor

## What is it?

*Concision Editor is a bit like [Editsaurus](https://editsaurus.tylerwalters.com/) or Hemingway Editor, but for MS Word.*

**Filler words** that can take away from your argument are highlighted <p style="background-color: #FFFF00">yellow.</p>
**Pronouns** are highlighted <p style="background-color: #CCC">gray.</p>  Make sure they point to a concrete noun.
**Adverbs** are highlighted <p style="background-color: #00F">bright green.</p>  These can also take away from your paper's impact.
**Complex words** with simpler alternatives (like Concision) are highlighted <p style="background-color: #CFF">turquoise.</p>

Word does a good job of picking up certain categories of grammar problems.  For the rest, try Concision.

## Main advantages of using a Word VBA script over an online grammar checker:
- You can check large documents (200 pages or more) without copy/pasting into a browser
- If the document is sensitive, there is no risk of sending information to a server somewhere on the Internet.  Everything stays with you.

## *But macros and scripts can be dangerous!*
True.  Go to [Concision Editor.vbs](https://github.com/Travis42/Concision-Editor/blob/master/Concision%20Editor.vbs) to read the script, so you'll know that there's nothing amiss.  You can manually add it to your own Word document instead of using the .docm file if you prefer.  I understand your concerns.

## Steps to use:

### Method 1:
-	Alt-F11, copy the script
-	Open a copy of your paper, Alt-F11
-	Choose Insert --> module
-	Paste the script into the module screen
-	F5 while your cursor has selected the script screen, grab a coffee
-	'Save as' something if you like.

### Method 2:
-	Paste your content into the docm.
-	Alt-F11, find the script (should come right up)
-	F5 while your cursor has selected the script screen, grab a coffee
-	'Save as' something if you like.
