# Write-More-Better
A grammar highlighter for Microsoft Word to make your writing clear and persuasive.

*Its a bit like [Editsaurus](https://github.com/tylerwalters/editsaurus) or Hemingway Editor for Word. See a list of [alternative software](https://alternativeto.net/software/editsaurus/) for the full gist of what this enables you and your team to do.*

## The main advantages of using a Word VBA script over an online grammar checker:
- You can check large documents (~200 pages or more) easily
- If the document is sensitive, you won't risk sending information to a server somewhere on the Internet.  Everything stays with you.

## But macros and scripts can be dangerous!
It is dangerous out there.  Go to [Write More Better.vbs](https://github.com/Travis42/Write-More-Better/blob/master/Write%20More%20Better.vbs) to read the script, so you'll know that there's nothing up.  If you like, you can manually add it to your own Word document instead of using the .docm file.  I understand your concerns.

## Steps to use:

### Method 1:
-	Alt-F11, copy the script
-	Open a copy of your paper, Alt-F11
-	Choose Insert --> module
-	Paste the script into the module screen
-	F5 while your cursor has selected the script screen, grab a coffee
-	'Save as' something if you like.

### Method 2:
-	Paste your content into the docm.
-	Alt-F11, find the script (should come right up)
-	F5 while your cursor has selected the script screen, grab a coffee
-	'save as' something if you like.
